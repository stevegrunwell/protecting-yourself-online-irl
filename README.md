# Protecting Yourself Online and IRL

There's an old adage about fools and money being easily separated, but the same can be said for data. Every day, people are finding new and innovative ways to harvest information about you, whether it's for fame, fortune, or just for the lulz.

You don't need to be a victim, though. Applying some basic operational and information security ("OpSec" and "InfoSec", respectively) principles, we can better protect our personal information from those who might try to steal it.

In this talk, we'll cover the fundamentals of what you should know to protect yourself both online and out in the real world. We'll cover topics including password security, phishing attacks, social engineering, and more. Attendees will leave with actionable steps they can use to reduce their own personal attack surfaces, along with a better understanding of the threats we face every day.
